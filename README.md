### Hi there, I am Cecilie Aagedal 👋

#### I am a full-time student at noroff university, studying front-end development.

I am currently living in Kristiansand, Norway with my boyfriend and daughter. I used to work in the service/restaraunt bussiness, but I never felt at home there. As a lifelong gamer and avid explorer of the world wide webs, I decided that gender shouldnt be an obsticle for my passions, so I signed up to uni and my real journey can finally start.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfilio website!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all HTML/CSS/javaScript etc. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on something that could make a change... or just spark my interests.
- 💬 Ask me about anything :D
- ⚡ Fun fact: I met my fiancè through call of duty 13 years ago, when he was learning me to quickscope. Now I am better than him.

#### I really enjoy music, here you have a little view into my world
